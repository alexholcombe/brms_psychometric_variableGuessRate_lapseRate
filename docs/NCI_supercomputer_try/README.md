We originally were trying out the supercomputer with files here to learn how to use it, but realized it should be in a separate repo,
which for now is https://github.com/SwamiVT/BRMS_Supercomputer .  With that system, on the supercomputer we can pull this repo for the Rscripts, 
but all the shell files are managed in  https://github.com/SwamiVT/BRMS_Supercomputer .
