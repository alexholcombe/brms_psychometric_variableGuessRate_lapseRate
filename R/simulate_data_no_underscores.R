# Creating Simulated Data
# In order to build and test our model in brms, we must first create a simulated data set that is similar to our actual experiment data. This allows us to confirm the brms model is working and successfully recovers the parameters we set before applying it to our real experimental data that has unknown parameter values. In the actual data, there will be many group-wise differences in location and scale parameters. The following simulated data only has explicit differences between the $\eta$ (location) of the two age groups (older vs younger).

  #speeds<-seq(.02,1.8, length.out = 12) # trials at 12 different speeds between .02 and 1.8
